- [x] createSink returns a stream composed of
  - [x] a through (refactored from stream.js)
    that outputs a batch and consumes log records
    
  - [x] Whenever the emit condition is met, it creates a batch
    containing the meta record and the current bucket state

  - [x] a sink that simply writes the batch to leveldb (using pull.drain)

- [x] a bucket is initialised with the last record in leveldb

  Emit condition
  - [x] a record is encountered that does not fit
        the current bucket
  - [x] the source did not provide new data in a while
  - [x] the source ends
  - [x] more than N log records went into the bucket since
        last flush
